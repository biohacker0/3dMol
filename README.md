## Introduction

Protein Sequence Annotation is a web application designed to facilitate the annotation and visualization of protein sequences. It allows users to upload PDB (Protein Data Bank) files, annotate specific segments of the protein sequence, and visualize them in 3D.

## Features

- **Upload PDB Files:** Users can upload PDB files containing protein structures.
- **Annotate Protein Segments:** Users can annotate specific segments of the protein sequence by specifying start and end indexes along with color preferences.
- **Visualize in 3D:** The annotated protein segments are visualized in a 3D molecular structure using 3Dmol.js library.
- **Interactive Display:** The tool provides an interactive display of the protein sequence, highlighting annotated segments for easy identification.

## Usage

1. **Upload PDB File:**
   - Click on the "Upload PDB File" button.
   - Select the desired PDB file from your local system.

2. **Annotate Protein Segments:**
   - Enter the start and end indexes for the segment you want to annotate.
   - Choose a color for the annotation.
   - Click on the "Annotate" button to apply the annotation.

3. **Visualize in 3D:**
   - The annotated protein segments will be visualized in a 3D molecular structure below the annotation controls.

## Installation
